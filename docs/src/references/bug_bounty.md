# Bug Bounty

Our Immunefi Bug Bounty program will be live on 09/25/23, with up to $50k in rewards.

## Note for Whitehats:

To simulate an upgraded AMKT V2 environment, we've deployed a separate set of mainnet contracts specifically for whitehats, which uses the same set of contracts as AMKT with minimally modified configurations (e.g. Multisig address is different). Total supply on this environment is roughly ~1000x less than that of real AMKT, reflecting about ~$2k in TVL.
