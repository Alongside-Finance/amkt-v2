Ethereum Consensus Tests   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/tests.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/tests)
=====

Common tests for all clients to test against. Test execution tool: https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth

Test Formats
------------

Maintained tests:

```
/BasicTests
/BlockchainTests
/GeneralStateTests
/TransactionTests
/RLPTest
/src
```


See descriptions of the different test formats in the official documentation at  http://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/.

*Note*:  
The format of BlockchainTests recently changed with the introduction of a new field ``sealEngine`` (values: ``NoProof`` | ``Ethash``), see related JSON Schema [change](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/commit/3be71ec3364a01fd4f2cb9b9fd086f3f69f0225c) or BlockchainTest format [docs](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_types/blockchain_tests.html) for reference.

This means that you can skip PoW validation for ``NoProof`` tests but also has the consequence that it is not possible to rely on/check ``PoW`` related block parameters for these tests any more.

Clients using the library
-------------------------

The following clients make use of the tests from this library. You can use these implementations for inspiration on how to integrate. If your client is missing, please submit a PR (requirement: at least some minimal test documentation)!

Using the Tests
---------------

We do [versioned tag releases](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases) for tests and you should aim to run your client libraries against the latest repository snapshot tagged. 

Generally the [develop](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop) branch in ``ethereum/tests`` is always meant to be stable and you should be able to run your test against.

Contribute to the Test Suite
----------------------------

See the dedicated [section](https://ethereum-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generating-tests.html) in the docs on how to write new tests. Or https://github.com/ethereum/retesteth/wiki/Creating-a-State-Test-with-retesteth

If you want to follow up with current tasks and what is currently in the works, have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues) 

Currently the C++ ``Aleth`` client is the reference client for generating tests. Have a look at [issues](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atesteth) and [PRs](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Atesteth) tagged with ``testeth`` to get an idea what is currently being worked on regarding the test generation process.
